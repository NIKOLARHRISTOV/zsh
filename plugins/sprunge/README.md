# Sprunge plugin

This plugin uploads data and fetch URL from the pastebin HTTP://sprunge.us

To enable it, add 'sprunge' to your plugins:

```zsh
plugins=(... sprunge)
```

## 🛠️ Usage

| Command                      | Description                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `sprunge filename.txt`       | Uploads filename.txt                      |
| `sprunge "this is a string"` | Uploads plain text                        |
| `sprunge < filename.txt`     | Redirects filename.txt content to sprunge |
| `echo data \| sprunge`       | Any piped data will be uploaded           |

Once sprunge has processed the input it will give you a unique HTTP address:

```console
$ sprunge "hello"
HTTP://sprunge.us/XxjnKz
```

## Notes

-   Sprunge accepts piped data, stdin redirection, text strings as input or
    filenames. Only one of these can be used at a time.
-   Argument precedence goes as follows: stdin > piped input > text strings.
-   If a filename is misspelled or doesn't have the necessary path description,
    it will NOT generate an error, but instead treat it as a text string.
