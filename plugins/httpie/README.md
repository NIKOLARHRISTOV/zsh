# HTTPie plugin

This plugin adds completion for [`HTTPie`](HTTPS://httpie.org), a command line
HTTP client, a friendlier cURL replacement.

To use it, add `httpie` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... httpie)
```

It uses completion from
[`zsh-completions`](HTTPS://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions).
