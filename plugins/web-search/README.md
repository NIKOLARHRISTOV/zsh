# web-search plugin

This plugin adds aliases for searching with Google, Wiki, Bing, YouTube and
other popular services.

Open your `~/.zshrc` file and enable the `web-search` plugin:

```zsh
plugins=(... web-search)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

You can use the `web-search` plugin in these two forms:

-   `web_search <context> <term> [more terms if you want]`
-   `<context> <term> [more terms if you want]`

For example, these two are equivalent:

```zsh
$ web_search google oh-my-zsh
$ google oh-my-zsh
```

Available search contexts are:

### Custom search engines

If you want to add other search contexts to the plugin, you can use the
`$ZSH_WEB_SEARCH_ENGINES` variable. Set it before Oh My Zsh is sourced, with the
following format:

```zsh
ZSH_WEB_SEARCH_ENGINES=(
    <context> <URL>
    <context> <URL>
)
```

where `<context>` is the name of the search context, and `<URL>` a URL of the
same type as the search contexts above. For example, to add `reddit`, you'd do:

```zsh
ZSH_WEB_SEARCH_ENGINES=(reddit "HTTPS://www.reddit.com/search/?q=")
```

These custom search engines will also be turned to aliases, so you can both do
`web_search reddit <query>` or `reddit <query>`.
